    <h1>"E"</h1>
    <h3>29 November 2010</h3>

    <p>
    IQ is something we know deceptively little about. We think we understand it, but generally, it's not totally well understood. I'd highly recommend a deep dive into this done by Radiolab, a radio series called "G". The value G stands for General Intelligence, and is measured in IQ points. G is essentially a type of mental performance related to how well we can solve problems.
    </p>

    <p>
    There's not much effort to measure "E" (emotional intelligence, in the same form as "G" above), in fact there's not even an agreed upon unit. It's just as important, if not more important. The distinction is that Emotional Intelligence is about how we position ourselves for other types of performance. 
    </p>

    <p>
    And yes, if you have a solid emotional intelligence, you're going to be able to improve yourself in areas such as General Intelligence. G is not fixed, you are not born with a set amount of IQ points. A solid emotional effort can lead you to improve your ability to solve problems. Same with physical performance, which is another class of measurable performance.
    </p>

    <p>
    But beyond that, emotional intelligence is also about your relationship with yourself, and your relationship with others. Even high performers can be their own worst partner, negatively influencing their own mood even when performance is high.
    </p>

    <p>
    You can also be the smartest person in the room, but if you don't have a high EQ, you will not be a good leader and will in fact drive people away from you despite your great ideas and problem performance. A leader with high E is usually one of the biggest indicator of a high performing team, and will also attract and keep great talent.

    <h1>This is your brain on learning</h1>
    <h3>6 December 2010</h3>

    <h3 id="neruoplasticity">Neruoplasticity</h3>
    <p>Neuroplasticity is about how the brain is able to change. it&#39;s not necessarily about whether the brain is
      able to learn stuff or not, but it&#39;s about the connections in the brain being reformed. Now in childhood,
      neuroplasticity is naturally high. Comparing this to when you&#39;re older, you wouldn&#39;t necessarily say a
      negative thing like your brain is inelastic, but you would actually say that your brain is stable. That can be
      really important for a number of different tasks inside your brain. If you already know how to render images from
      your eyes, you don&#39;t actually want to be neuroplastic in that area at all.</p>
    <p>So that&#39;s what our brain does. It shuts down the neuroplasticity, and solidifies and stabilizes our brain
      connections so it can be predictable and it can function in the way that it was taught when the critical period,
      as scientists call it, was open.</p>
    <p>Now this is quite positive. Again because you don&#39;t want your brain to be restructuring things that work. But
      what if we want to benefit our brains? This is possible, mainly through repetition and practice.</p>
    <p>it&#39;s also important to maintain a growth mindset throughout this because it is proven that if you are aware
      of the fact that you are able to change yourself, that simple fact can actually help you make that change
      physiologically inside your brain.</p>
    <p>I&#39;ll link this one YouTube video which is probably quite academic but I found really fascinating listening to
      the leaders of this area of research discuss this in depth.</p>

    <h3 id="growth-mindset">Growth mindset</h3>
    <p>growth mindset is actually quite linked to the idea of neuroplasticity, but it&#39;s a little bit more general.
      Neuroplasticity is applied to the physiological changing and restructuring of our brain. But changes in our brain
      is not the only way that we can improve ourselves.</p>
    <p>We all intuitively know that if we go to the gym we&#39;re going to get stronger, or faster, or have a greater
      endurance. what it&#39;s about is understanding the way that we can change for the better and understanding the
      practical steps to do such things.</p>
    <p>In learning when it comes to pursuits of the mind, it&#39;s incredibly important for us to recognize the ability
      to change. Many people will plateau or come up to a point where they are unable to improve with simple repetition.
      They might believe that it is not possible for them to get past that point because they have reached their natural
      potential. But research does not bear this out. When it comes to a growth mindset it&#39;s about saying,
      &quot;this difficulty I&#39;m having getting past this problem is a problem to be solved, I have to change my
      strategy&quot;.</p>
    <p>In peak by Andrew Erickson, there was a man and a researcher compartment together to teach this man to learn how
      to memorize a short strings of numbers. The method was simple, they would meet for a session and the researcher
      would give him a string of numbers with a small pause between them for example, 2 9 5, would be a string of length
      three. The subject would then repeat those numbers back to the researcher.</p>
    <p>Most people can do this to about seven or eight digits without any training. But even with some light training,
      most people would not be able to get past 15 or so. What the researcher did was he would, every time the subject
      got the numbers correct, he would increase the length of the next string. That increase of length would increase
      the difficulty. he would do the same thing if the subject didn&#39;t get it correct, the next string that he said
      would have one less digit than the one before.</p>
    <p>In this way it pushed the subject to be as challenged as possible at all times. When the subject was able to get
      to 50, a string of 51 would be his next challenge.</p>
    <p>What I found striking is the way that this particular subject approached the process. Whenever he reached a
      plateau, he would change the way he memorized the numbers, he would group them in different ways, or try different
      methods of storing the numbers in his brain. there were some other subjects, including the second subject who just
      tried to do the same thing but continued it. In other words they didn&#39;t adjust their strategy, they just kept
      trying the same strategy for longer even when they were in plateau.</p>
    <p>I would surmise that that first person was in a growth mindset. they didn&#39;t see a limitation, genetic or
      otherwise, in the ability for them to memorize more and more numbers. They were always looking for a way they
      could get to the next challenge level. in comparison that other person likely had a fixed mindset, in which they
      believed that they were unable to do it, or were much more easily demoralized when presented with long stretches
      of no improvement.</p>
    <p>Of course this links back to the idea of neuroplasticity. If that first subject was unable to rewire the parts in
      his brain, even as an adult, he would have not been able to get to over 200 digits remembered. it&#39;s an
      incredible overperformance from what an average person can do, and he wasn&#39;t trained when he was young at all.
    </p>
    <p>A lot of my understanding of this topic does come from the book peak by Anders Erickson, which analyzes the top
      performers in given fields.</p>
    <p>It is my intention to try and always make sure that I am being challenged once we get to the boot camp. I really
      want to be pushed, and I don&#39;t want to be doing things that are just easy, because it&#39;s the challenge that
      actually brings the growth.</p>

    <h1>Tech 4</h1>
    <h3>6 December 2010</h3>

    <h3>Simple blockers</h3>

    <p>
      In the Sprint I had a simple problem, where all I was missing was two brackets. I was a little bit stumped when I looked at the code as it was. What was essentially happening was where the answer should be, the computer instead put in the function, or the way that I should come to that answer. Was a little bit frustrating because it didn't seem like that was something that could happen, and I thought my code was solid. What I did then was just split out the code into separate lines, and do things a little bit more procedurally, one step at a time. Once I did that it was pretty easy to see what the problem was, and to show where the program was each step.

    <h3>An elegant solution</h3>

    <p>
      In the same sprint, I had a really good way of solving the superfizzbuzz program. In this problem, we had already written a more standard FizzBuzz, which took one number and printed the answer to the FizzBuzz problem. It was super easy and elegant to just pass that solution into a map function on the array that we were supposed to do super fizz buzz for. That simply ran the fizzbuzz across every element that was in that array. It felt quite good because the code was readable, and also simply one line, but not in a complex way.

    <h3>Problem solving technique</h3>

    <p>
      I feel pretty confident with most of The problem solving techniques. I think I prefer just writing down actual code rather than writing pseudocode. I find that I have written enough code, even though it's been a while, that I can think in the coding language itself, and if I need to write some pseudo code ish type stuff, I can do that in comments around what I'm doing, as a way to break down the program to simpler parts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of the technical things that you might do to solve problems, like reading error messages, and logging, are also pretty normal to me. I also pretty much Google everything I do. If I haven't used an inbuilt function in a while, I have no shame just looking it up on Google, Even before I have a problem with it. I believe it's also good to learn by just doing and not have to feel like you have to rely on memory.
    </p>

    <p>
      So far I haven't really had to ask people for help, But it is definitely a useful thing to be able to do.

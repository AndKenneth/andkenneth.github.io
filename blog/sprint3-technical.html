    HTML is only the information and structure, not how the page actually looks. I'd maybe consider it like a architectural model vs. a rendering of that model. The architectural model in the cad software is mainly going to be concerned with the structure and form of the building, but an artist can come along and dress it up to look really nice to show people what the actual building would look like.

    Control flow is about a series of decisions made based on certain conditions within the running of the program. For example, consider lunch. I would think around 12:30, first of all, am I hungry. If I was not hungry, I might keep considering my hunger until I am hungry enough to eat lunch, which might be represented as "While I'm not hungry, check if I'm hungry", essentially pausing the application until the while loop condition isn't met anymore. once "yes I'm hungry" is true, I would then say "If I'm lazy and feeling rich, order uber eats, else if I'm feeling rich, walk out to a restaurant, else check if there's something in the fridge".

    So the Document Object Model sounds fancy, and all it really is, is a tree. Not as much a leafy tree, but more a family tree. Objects can have parents who are above them, children who are below them, and sibling elements who are beside them. You can interact with the DOM by adding, removing, and changing these elements to change the structure of the data on a page. For example, we could have an element that has a list inside of it. We could get an array of the items within that element, and then modify each one in some way, like giving all of that elements children a haircut.

    So an array is generally used to carry a collection of like objects. In javascript, they don't *have* to be like that, but really it's good practice, and many other languages won't let you have a number and a string in the same array. This is because we generally want to act on each element in the array in the same way.
    </p>

    <p>
    An object is more about addressing a list of attributes for that object. For example a car might have a color attribute, and that can be 'red' or 'blue'. But it would also have a price attribute, which might be '10000'. You could not act on all of the elements in this object in the same way because they are different types of data.
    </p>

    <p>
    Functions are parts of programs that can be written once and "called" multiple times within that program. They are useful because generally in software we want to do the same thing the same way a lot of times, because that's what computers are good at.

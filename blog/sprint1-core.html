    <h3>A ethical decision</h3>

    <p>
      Somewhat of an unfortunate situation recently, we had a flatmate that just stopped paying his rent to us. Talking to him, he had actually lost his job, which was really unfortunate. I could have kicked him out at that point, but I really wanted to work with him. I tried to help him apply for JobSeekers, which I didn't have to do but I didn't want to have to just kick him out.      
    </p>

    <p>
      Our whole flat helped kick in and pay his rent in the meantime as well. Unfortunately it got to the point where we had to give him notice to leave. As much as I didn't want to have to have him leave, at that point he wasn't accepting our help (aside from the rent!) and it wasn't fair to my other flatmates to ask them to continue to subsidize him living there.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's kind of a weird ethical thing, and not really something that sounds flattering in a blog, because asking someone to leave potentially putting them on the street is bad, but it was the case that we did quite a bit that we wouldn't have done if we weren't willing to work with him. At the end I had an ethical obligation to the rest of my flatmates to get someone else in the flat so we all weren't subsidizing someone who wasn't accepting help.
    </p>

    <p>
      It still kinda feels sucky but I do know he was able to live with family and hopefully is able to get the help he needs that we weren't able to provide.
    </p>

    <h3>How culture has influenced my values + identity</h3>

    <p>
      Talking about my culture is interesting, because it's not really a static thing considering how I moved around when I was younger. I moved from the USA to Singapore when I was very young, and I lived as an expat there with my family. That was always temporary, but I really got to live around and get along with people of many different cultures. I consider what I'm seeing from family and friends back home in the states, and it really does seem grim the way it can be incredibly insular and that they seem to reject diversity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moving to New Zealand also meant that I was adopting a new culture. That came with a certain amount of culture shock, because there was no longer an expat community here - I really did have to join New Zealand culture. Some of that is Awesome, but I'm also able to have a slightly outsider viewpoint considering I adopted New Zealand culture instead of being moulded by it from the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think at this point I'm glad to be able to exist in and navigate New Zealand culture, but I also appreciate a certainelement of American culture that I retain that allows me to be really honest and take ownership. I've foundrecently that some of these elements were really appreciated at a place where I volunteer and run a small team of other volunteers there. It turns out that there's not many people who are able to just take total ownership of an area, but I feel like it really comes quite naturally to me.
    </p>

    <h3>Strengths and liminations.</h3>
    <p>
      I really like strenghts finders because it doesn't box people in, and it focuses mainly on the positives. My top 5 strengths are <em>Ideation, Positivity, Woo, Developer, and Empathy</em>. Three of these strenghts are about relationship building, with a strength each for strategic thinking (Ideation), and Influencing (Woo)
    </p>

    <p>I'm actually stoked with this set of strengths. I feel like it really fits me and fits my personality. I've said before that one of my biggest goals in life is to help people find their fit, and I totally think that comes through </p>

    <p>
      Noticably absent from anywhere near the top is execution strengths, and my top one of those is belief. This hits pretty hard, and I could see some issue with my Ideation and Positivity overscoping to an insane degree. Managing this is going to be essential while working with other people in the course and in the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      This has lots of examples in the business that I was involved in, as we in general had issues with exeucting on a million, probably very good, ideas. Unfortunately we didn't have great ways to deal with these disagreements, and we're not operating again. But if I was going to do that whole thing again, I would make sure there was some very good structure for us, and me, to follow.
    </p>

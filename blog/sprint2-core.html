    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    <h2>How 2 course.</h2>
    <h3>20 November 2010</h3>

    <p>
      I've had a quite varried career up to this point. I've done quite a few things which are really quite unique. I've done cyber work, done an esports startup, taught, and worked for a church. These don't seem like they really intersect well, and they really don't. But I see the value. I don't really want a lack of variety, but my career goals are to figure out what was good about all these things and merge it into a varried career that makes sense.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would like to build skills in how to appropriately collabarate on software with others, working to combine our strenghts to work the best together and create some really cool and useful products.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you'd like a description of my strenghts and weaknesses I completed that on my <a href="./sprint1-core.html">last blog</a>
    </p>

      I've already started to really clear my schedule. As much as I've loved it, I will have to bow out of my annual involvement in Narrows Park Easter Camp, and Totara Springs holiday camps. I will really miss them this year but it's not practical for me to continue when I know the course is going to require a lot of my time, and importantly attention.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I will keep committing to is production at my church. It's an important part of my support network, and a big part of my week. That will be on Sunday mornings each week, but I have started to prepare my team to produce our services without me.
    </p>

    <p>
      Really a big part of this will be for me to fully commit and not let other things creap into my time at the course.
    </p>

    <p>
      In terms of help and support, I would really just like the facilitation team to be honest with me about where I sit and how I'm doing.
